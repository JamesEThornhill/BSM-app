BSM_app.py runs a Streamlit app that uses the Black Scholes model to produce calculations and visualisations for European option prices.

The other .py files are modules that are called in BSM_app.py in order to carry out the calculations.

The app can be found here: https://blackscholesapp-jt.streamlit.app
